# UXG2176---A3-Assignment

For Mr Tommy Assignment



Do this before you implement your game puzzle or what not:



1. Read "UXG2176---A3 Assignment INSTRUCTIONS" and follow the instructions.
2. See "Rooms Assigned to you" and keep your work there so you won't bother other people's work.
3. Whatever you're gonna do the following:



* Make your room bigger
* Change the player code to make it move more smoothly
* Add more of your work in the Extra room for more grades and credits
* Etc



You MUST let me know!



4\. Anything you are unsure of? Text me on telegram, if I'm not responding for the next 15 minutes, you're free to call me.
